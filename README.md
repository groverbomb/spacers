## Torches in the Dark
###### A grim and dangerous game of adventure and survival in the far-future
### A long Time Ago...
Once the people of Terra 

These times are long gone. The legacy of The Greater Terran Epoch is almost
faded from memory. There are great halls still on the ancient and powerful Core
Clusters, and the great star factories of the Binary Forge still ring in the
stellar night. But they are far, far away.

You are a spacer. A desperate lunatic careening through the front lines of the
great Entropic Wave of time, the last force of nature which has never
known the yoke of man's command. Out here, it's just you, a few like-minded
maniacs, and a couple layers of Plastic, GoldFoam insulation, and compressed
air between you and the unbearabl fullness of the void. What's in it for you?
Nothing at all. But it's better than being locked in a dirt-side holding cell,
or forced in to the Marines. Yep. The Bad Old Times are back. The Weird Years
are setting in. So you suit up.

The Goals of this Document are:
1. To delete this two preceeding paragraphs as quickly as is reasonable.
2. Delelete the previous sentence. 
3. To ouline enough of a system to convincingly do a pre-alpha playtest, relying
heavily on the Torchbearer ruleset. This will primarly consist of developing
rudimentary rules and rulings for the following elements or situations
  - Five (5) Classes, modeled after the Torchbearer "division of labor"
  - Rules for Ships (creation, use, ship-to-ship interactions)
  - A Scenario?

So...

# Classes

Because of the framework of Torchbearer, we must early on deal with how to deal
with stocks. I am of the opinion that by allowing the alien into the players
sphere of play risks normalizing and domesticating the idea of the alien, which
is what drives so much of what I like in genre sci-fi. The
Predator is uninteresting because its goals are recognizable to us and in a way
communicated to us directly by the creature itself. The Xenomorph is terrifying
and perfect because it is so totally alien. It is without speech, sensory
organs. It does not appear to eat, and yet it grows horrifically. It's blood is
the void. This should be an engine of the game, this fear and perfection of the
truly alien. 
So, the choices then are human, cyborg, and synth. First pass classes:
Class|Primary Skills|Nature
The Human Pilot|Astrogation, 
The Human Engineer
The Human Smuggler
The Cyborg Soldier
The Synth Scientist
